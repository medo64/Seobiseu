This is a small program that allows starting and stopping services from user
account. It makes basic service management as easy as possible.

NOTICE: This program goes around UAC restrictions by installing service that is
able to start and stop other services within administrator context. In order to
have security hole as small as possible this service will NEVER be able to do
anything more. I personally never want application that can install other
services without user interaction.


#### Shortcut Keys ####

  * `F5`                      Start service
  * `Shift+F5`                Stop service
  * `Ins`                     Add service to list
  * `Del`                     Remove service from list


#### Name ####

This program is named after Korean phonetic transliteration of word service. In
original form it is written as 서비스. Name was selected primarily because it
sounds good and I wasn't able to find other program by same name. And I was out
of better ideas. :)
